# JSX Streaming

Provides a async streaming serializer for JSX, primarily for server-side
rendering, although it could work in browser, esp in a worker.

Builds on top of `@http/token-stream` & `@http/html-stream`.

Documentation is coming soon, until then read about the general concept
[here](https://jollytoad.deno.dev/blog/jsx_streaming).

## Example

See the [examples](../examples) for an idea of how this is used.

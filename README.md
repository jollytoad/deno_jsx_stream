# JSX Streaming

Provides a server-side only async streaming serializer for JSX.

Documentation is coming soon, until then read about the general concept
[here](https://jollytoad.deno.dev/blog/jsx_streaming).

## Example

See the [example](./example/page.tsx) for an idea of how this is used.

You can start the example with:

```sh
deno task example
```

Then open the app in a browser and manually change the URL path.
